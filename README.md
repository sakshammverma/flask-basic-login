# Flask Basic Login App

This is one of my early Flask projects — a simple login/logout system using sessions.  
It doesn’t use a database yet; just hardcoded credentials (`Saksham / 123`).

I mainly built this to get hands-on practice with:
- Flask routing and session management
- Jinja2 templating
- Basic login flow
- Pushing a project to GitHub using terminal

This was also part of learning how to work with Git and GitHub from the command line.
